NAME
    Kwiki::Image - More comprehensive WAFL support for images.

SYNOPSIS
     $ cpan Kwiki::Image
     $ cd /path/to/kwiki
     $ echo "Kwiki::Image" >> plugins
     $ kwiki -update

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides more comprehensive support for images in Kwiki.

    It allows assigning a class to an image, surrounding the image with
    a link tag, and adding an alt attribute.  It also allows a dynamically
    created image to be treated as an image, even if it doesn't have one of the
    standard image extensions that the Kwiki formatter looks for.

    The Kwiki format is {image:src url alt class}.  The last 1, 2, or 3 items
    in the list may be omitted.

    For example:

      {image:http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif http://www.google.com Google inline}

    will render as:

      <a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" alt="Google" class="inline" /></a>

    For XHTML compliance, a default alt attribute is included if omitted:

      {image:http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif http://www.google.com}

    will render as:

      <a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif" alt="Image" /></a>

    Another example:

      {image:http://www.nowhere.com/images/fancygraph?type=onthefly}

    will render as:

      <img src="http://www.nowhere.com/images/fancygraph?type=onthefly" alt="Image" />
